The shared dependencies between the files we are generating are:

1. **SQL Syntax**: All the SQL snippets will share the common SQL syntax and structure. This includes the use of SQL keywords like SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE, JOIN, etc.

2. **Database Schema**: All the SQL snippets will be based on a common database schema. This includes table names, column names, data types, constraints, etc.

3. **README.md**: This file will contain the descriptions of all the SQL snippets. The names of the snippets in the README.md file will match the names of the SQL files in the snippets directory.

4. **Directory Structure**: All the SQL snippets will be stored in the 'snippets' directory. The directory structure is shared across all the SQL files.

5. **File Names**: The names of the SQL files are shared across the README.md file and the 'snippets' directory. The file names are also the identifiers for the SQL snippets.

6. **SQL Functions**: Some SQL snippets might use common SQL functions like COUNT(), SUM(), AVG(), etc. These function names are shared across the SQL snippets.

Please note that since these are SQL snippets, there are no exported variables, id names of DOM elements, message names, or JavaScript function names involved.
